Active Learning and Spaced Repetition are two learning techniques that have been [highly recommended](https://blog.readwise.io/hack-your-brain-with-spaced-repetition-and-active-recall/) to improve learning retention and recall.

They have been widely used as study aids by students preparing for exams (especially medical students), as an aid for [reading books](https://blog.readwise.io/hack-your-brain-with-spaced-repetition-and-active-recall/), and even for [learning foreign languages](https://chatterbug.com/blog/en/2019-03-14-developing-a-new-curriculum).

This project explores how feasible and effective can such tools and techniques be applied to learn and master a computer programming langauge - Golang.
